<h1>Favorite Quotes from Read Books</h1>
<hr/>

<p><b>The Three Body Problem by Liu Cixin</b>
  <br />"On Earth, humankind can step onto another continent, and without a thought, destroy the kindred civilizations found there... But when they gaze up at the stars, they ... believe that [there] must be civilizations bound by universal, noble, moral constraints, as if cherishing and loving different forms of life are parts of a self-evident universal code of conduct. I think it should be precisely the opposite: Let’s turn the kindness we show toward the stars to members of the human race on Earth”
<p><b>The Dark Forest by Liu Cixin</b>
  <br />“If I destroy you, what business is it of yours?”
<p><b>Death's End by Liu Cixin</b>
  <br />“The ultimate fate of all intelligent beings has always been to become as grand as their thoughts"

<p><b>When Breath Becomes Air by Robert Kalanith</b>
  <br />“You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.”

<p><b>Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil</b>
  <br />“Here we see that models, despite their reputation for impartiality, reflect goals and ideology. Our own values and desires influence our choices, from the data we choose to collect to the questions we ask. Models are opinions embedded in mathematics.”

<p><b>What My Bones Know by Stephanie Foo</b>
  <br />“Over and over, the answer is the same, isn’t it? Love, love, love. The salve and the cure. In order to become a better person, I had to do something utterly unintuitive. I had to reject the idea that punishing myself would solve the problem. I had to find the love.”

<p><b>Solito, A Memoir by Javier Zamora</b>
  <br />“Grandpa isn't here to talk to me before falling asleep, to go out for walks and explore the town, and because of that I feel alone, lonely, solo, solito, solito de verdad.”
