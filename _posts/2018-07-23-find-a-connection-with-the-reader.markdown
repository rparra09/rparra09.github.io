This project uses a K-Means clustering method to find unique groupings of Walt Disney films (not Disney+ releases, only those with Box Office revenue) by identifying patterns and trends beyond simply sorting. I use Python for its ease-of-use, plotting capabilities, and wide-array of K-Means methods.  

K-Means clustering is considered a fairly straightforward a partitioning technique: tell the model how many groups you want and assign all the data points to the appropriate group.
