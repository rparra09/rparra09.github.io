The WiDS Datathon 2024 focuses on a prediction task using a roughly 39k record dataset of  patients and their characteristics (age, race, BMI, zip code), their diagnosis and treatment information (breast cancer diagnosis code, treatments… etc.), their geo (zip-code level) demographic data (income, education, rent, race, poverty, …etc), as well as toxic air quality data (Ozone, PM25 and NO2) that tie health outcomes to environmental conditions. 
<p></p>
The main task was to assess whether the "likelihood of the patient’s Diagnosis Period being less than 90 days is predictable using these characteristics and information about the patient."
Feature selection and data cleaning took the most time to complete.
